# Internship_Cpp

This is my C++ repository. In this repository, I included the tasks I was given during my internship starting date. This file includes three folders and each folder carries one task.

Task 1:
      I made a simple calculator which can perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will first ask the user to give two numbers as input and then which operation to perform. It will give output according to the user's input. Here is the link for this task: https://github.com/RanaTalha04/Internship_Cpp/tree/master/Calculator%20(Task%201).

Task 2:
      I made a simple temperature converter scale that will convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. It will ask the user to give input and then will convert it into the desired output. Here is the link for this task: https://github.com/RanaTalha04/Internship_Cpp/tree/master/Temperature%20Converter%20(Task%202).

Task 3:
       I made a simple number-guessing game. In this game, the user will give input between 1 to 100 and the system will compare it with the secret number and will give hints accordingly. If the number will be greater it will display "Try higher number" and vice versa. Here is the link for this task:
